## How to contribute to this project

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/fga-gpp-mds/NOME/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/fga-gpp-mds/NOME/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, use one of the **templates** - providing at least all the information required there - and a **code sample** or an **screenshot** showing the problem.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Provide all the info that
is required on the template and be sure to include the relevant issue number, if applicable.

* Be sure to commit following our [commit policy]()

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* First, check on the [issue list](https://github.com/fga-gpp-mds/NOME/issues) 
and be sure no one is already making a feature like the
one you intend. If there is no such a thing, you may proceed.

* Open a new issue with a feature-custom template [here](https://github.com/fga-gpp-mds/NOME/issues/new?template=feature.md).
GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
